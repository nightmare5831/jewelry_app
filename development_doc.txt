================================================================================
YOUR 3 REQUIREMENTS - OUR SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

1. SELLER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
----------------------------

Your Request:
"Can we include an interface for sellers through special logins? Regular users
cannot choose to be sellers. We must be able to select and allow seller
registration ourselves."

Our Solution:
✓ Users can request seller access through the app
✓ YOU (Super Admin) receive notification
✓ YOU approve or reject each seller request
✓ Only approved sellers can add products
✓ Web dashboard to manage all sellers
✓ You can deactivate sellers anytime

Deliverable: Complete seller approval system with notifications


2. AUTOMATED EMAILS
-------------------

Your Request:
"The app should send pre-programmed messages when users register (welcome
emails), make purchases (thank you and confirmation), when new items are added,
and when sellers ship products."

Our Solution:
✓ Welcome Email - Sent when user registers
✓ Purchase Confirmation - Sent after payment with order details
✓ New Product Alert - Sent to all users when items added to catalog
✓ Shipping Notification - Sent when seller ships with tracking number

BONUS: You can edit all email templates through admin panel
        Preview emails before they go live
        Track email delivery

Deliverable: 4 automated email types + admin editor


3. DYNAMIC GOLD PRICING
------------------------

Your Request:
"Products sold change prices dynamically along with fluctuations in the value
of gold. I need an algorithm that frequently searches for gold prices on Google
and increases or decreases the value of all products by percentages equivalent
to the amount of gold in the piece."

Our Solution:
✓ System checks gold price every 4 hours automatically
✓ Connects to gold price API (GoldAPI.io - $10-15/month)
✓ Updates ALL product prices automatically
✓ No manual work needed

HOW IT WORKS:
1. System fetches current gold price (R$ per gram)
2. For each product, calculates new price using formula:

   New Price = Base Price × (Current Gold Price ÷ Initial Gold Price)

EXAMPLE:
   Product: Gold Ring
   Base Price: R$ 1,000
   Gold Weight: 5 grams
   Initial Gold Price: R$ 300/gram
   Current Gold Price: R$ 330/gram (10% increase)

   Calculation: R$ 1,000 × (330 ÷ 300) = R$ 1,100

   Result: Price automatically updates to R$ 1,100

SUPER ADMIN CONTROLS:
✓ View current gold price
✓ See price history chart
✓ Manual override if API fails
✓ Set update frequency
✓ Set min/max price limits

Deliverable: Fully automated gold pricing with manual controls
